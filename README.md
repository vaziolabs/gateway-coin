# Gateway Token (GATE)

A protocol-agnostic cross-chain bridge enabling seamless asset transfers between blockchain networks, built on FragMint Chain.

## Overview

## Architecture
The Gateway Token operates on FragMint's block-matrix architecture, utilizing:
- Temporal-spatial epochs organized in tensor format
- 2D vector allocations for improved transaction mapping
- Matrix-based state verification instead of traditional Merkle trees
- Multi-dimensional transaction routing

### Price Stability Mechanism
- **Time-Decay Value System**:
  - Base value: 1:1 USDC peg for immediate transactions
  - Progressive demurrage based on holding duration
  - Value decay tracked through tensor epochs
  - No staking or yield mechanisms

### Economic Design
- **Anti-Speculation Features**:
  - Transaction fees increase with token age
  - No yield/staking rewards
  - Programmatic demurrage (negative interest)
  - Value derived purely from utility as bridge medium

### Temporal Value Mechanics
- **Decay Formula**:
  - Initial Value: 1 USDC
  - Decay Rate: [X]% per tensor epoch
  - Maximum Holding Penalty: [Y]%
  - Reset on transfer/bridge operation

### Stability Pool Economics
- **Revenue Structure**:
  - Time-decay penalties feed stability pool
  - Bridge operation fees
  - Tensor transaction fees
- **Usage**:
  - Maintaining 1:1 USDC liquidity
  - Emergency stability operations
  - Cross-chain bridge reserves

### Matrix-Based Implementation
- Tensor epochs track holding duration
- 2D vector mapping of token age
- Cross-chain decay synchronization
- Real-time value adjustment calculations

### Circuit Breakers
- Maximum decay rate limits
- Emergency value floor
- Cross-chain synchronization delays
- Minimum transaction thresholds

### Elastic Supply Operations
- **Rebase Mechanics**:
  - Automatic token quantity adjustments for all holders based on price movements
  - Example: 10 GATE → 20 GATE when price doubles, maintaining $1.00 per token value
  - Rebases occur at epoch boundaries within the tensor structure

### Stability Pool Economics
- **Earnings Structure**:
  - Accumulates fees from tensor transactions
  - Revenue from epoch updates across the network
  - Cross-chain bridge operation fees
- **Fee Distribution**:
  - Portion allocated to maintain stability reserves
  - Remainder used for automatic rebase operations
  - Emergency buffer for extreme market conditions

### Matrix-Based Rebase Protocol
- Tensor-synchronized supply adjustments
- 2D vector tracking of holder balances
- Epoch-boundary rebase calculations
- Cross-chain balance synchronization
- Proportional distribution across all wallets

## Key Features
- Multi-chain support (Ethereum, Solana, Bitcoin, Polygon, NEAR, Radix, Cosmos)
- Secure bridge operations via STOQ Protocol
- Decentralized validator network
- Native token (GATE) for governance and operations

## Token Economics
- **Target Price**: $1.00 (1:1 with USDC)
- **Total Supply**: Dynamic based on demand
- **Distribution**:
  - Validator Pool: [X]%
  - Stability Reserve: [Y]% (New)
  - Development Fund: [Z]%
  - Community Reserve: [W]%

## Integration

### Quick Start
```solidity
interface IGATEIntegration {
    // Core integration functions
    function integrateGATE(
        address gateToken,
        uint256 amount,
        bytes32 tensorEpoch,
        bytes calldata integrationData
    ) external returns (bool);

    function withdrawGATE(
        address recipient,
        uint256 amount,
        bytes32 tensorEpoch,
        bytes calldata withdrawData
    ) external returns (bool);

    // Rebase tracking
    function getRebaseRatio(
        bytes32 tensorEpoch
    ) external view returns (uint256 ratio);

    function getAdjustedBalance(
        address account,
        bytes32 tensorEpoch
    ) external view returns (uint256 balance);

    // Matrix state verification
    function verifyMatrixState(
        bytes32 tensorEpoch,
        bytes calldata stateProof
    ) external view returns (bool);
}

interface IGATEEvents {
    event RebaseOccurred(
        bytes32 indexed tensorEpoch,
        uint256 rebaseRatio,
        uint256 newTotalSupply
    );
    
    event TensorStateUpdate(
        bytes32 indexed tensorEpoch,
        bytes32 stateRoot,
        uint256 timestamp
    );

`solana config set --url testnet`

### Economic Equilibrium Model

#### Holding Cost Formula
For non-participating holders:
```
D(t) = P₀(1 - re^(-kt))

Where:
D(t) = Token value after time t
P₀ = Initial token value (1 USDC)
r = Base decay rate (0.02)
k = Time constant (epochs)
t = Holding duration in epochs
```

#### Network Participation Offset
For active participants:
```
R(v,t) = P₀(αv + βn)t

Where:
R(v,t) = Rewards over time t
v = Transaction volume
α = Volume coefficient (0.001)
β = Network participation factor
n = Number of network operations
```

#### Net Position Formula
```
NP(t) = P₀ + R(v,t) - D(t)

Participation Threshold:
R(v,t) ≥ D(t) for economic neutrality
```

### Stability Mechanics

#### Value Preservation Conditions
```
For any epoch E:
∑(Inflows) = ∑(Outflows)
Where:
- Inflows = New deposits + Network rewards
- Outflows = Withdrawals + Decay penalties
```

#### Liquidity Balance
```
L(t) = ∑(Active_Holdings) / ∑(Total_Supply)

Target: 0.7 ≤ L(t) ≤ 0.9
```

### Network Participation Rewards

#### Transaction Fee Distribution
```
F(p) = b * (1 + μp)

Where:
F(p) = Fee for participant p
b = Base fee (0.001 USDC)
μ = Participation multiplier
p = Participation score (0 to 1)
```

#### Negative Interest Offset
```
O(a) = ∑(D(t)) * (τa/τt)

Where:
O(a) = Offset amount
τa = Active participation time
τt = Total time period
```

### Stability Pool Mechanics

#### Reserve Requirements
```
SR(t) = max(0.2 * TS, ∑(D(t)))

Where:
SR(t) = Stability reserve at time t
TS = Total supply
∑(D(t)) = Sum of all decay penalties
```

#### Network Health Index
```
H(t) = (AP/TH) * (L(t)/0.8) * (SR(t)/RR)

Where:
H(t) = Health index (target > 1.0)
AP = Active participants
TH = Total holders
L(t) = Liquidity ratio
RR = Required reserve
```

### Integration Considerations
- Balance tracking must account for both decay and participation rewards
- Real-time participation metrics influence reward distribution
- Cross-chain operations must maintain consistent reward/decay ratios
- Tensor epochs synchronize reward and decay calculations
