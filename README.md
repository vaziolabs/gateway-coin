# Gateway Coin (GATE)

Gateway Coin serves as the intermediary token for cross-chain financial transactions, enabling seamless integration between multiple blockchain networks and the FragMint ecosystem.

## Purpose

- Acts as a bridge token for cross-chain transactions
- Facilitates automated financial contract execution
- Enables interoperability between major blockchain networks
- Provides liquidity for asset tokenization and exchange

## Core Integration Points

### 1. Blockchain Network Integration
- Ethereum (ETH)
  - Smart contract integration for financial assets (ERC-20)
  - NFT and multi-token support (ERC-721, ERC-1155)
  - Tangible asset management
  - Account management protocols
- Bitcoin (BTC)
  - Payment channel integration
  - Cross-chain atomic swaps
- Additional Networks
  - Solana (SPL Token integration)
  - Polygon (ERC compatibility layer)
  - 0x Protocol (DEX integration)

### 2. FragMint Integration
- Primary state management and contract execution layer
- Real-world asset tokenization protocols
- Multi-token validation and tracking
- Cross-chain state synchronization
- Asset wrapper contracts for external tokens

### 3. Cross-Chain Bridge Architecture
- Token Wrapping Mechanisms
  - ERC-20 wrapping protocols
  - NFT bridging (ERC-721, ERC-1155)
  - Custom asset wrapper contracts
- State Management
  - FragMint-based state verification
  - Cross-chain merkle proofs
  - Multi-signature validation
- Bridge Security
  - Validator networks
  - Threshold signatures
  - Time-locked security mechanisms
